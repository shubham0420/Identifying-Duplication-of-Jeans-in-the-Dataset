# Identifying-Duplication-of-Jeans-in-the-Dataset

The Dataset was provided by Huex.Some sellers upload the same product in different websites multiple time and some upload same product in
same website multiple times with reason known only to them.
The code identifies the cluster of Jeans that might be similar using K nearest neighbours. There is a pdf attached to the code which describes
the process that I applied while doing the machine learning.

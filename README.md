# Identifying-Duplication-of-Jeans-in-the-Dataset

The Dataset was provided by Huex.Some sellers upload the same product in different websites multiple time and some upload same product in
same website multiple times with reason known only to them.
The code identifies the cluster of Jeans that might be similar using K Means.  
There is a pdf attached to the code which describes the process that I applied while doing the machine learning.  

#### Steps :-
1. Run preprocessing.py to preprocess the dataset.
2. Run machine_learning_code.py
